# Deep Learning project for ECE 7123
## Image Captioning Model 
This is the final project for NYU tandon ECE 7123 Deep Learning. In this project, I Engineered an integration of Vision Transformer and LSTM models to translate image data into natural language descriptions. 

Optimized feature extraction using Vision Transformer (Vit-32/b) and developed an LSTM decoder for textual output. 

Fine-tuned hyperparameters and achieved progressive improvement in BLEU Score during training.

The database I used is MSCOCO 2014 for Image captioning.
